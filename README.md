The Dual Distribution System UI is a user interface that facilitates a dual distribution model, allowing clients to conveniently order goods and track their orders within the system. This UI provides a seamless and user-friendly experience for clients who need to manage their orders and keep track of their inventory.

Upon logging in, clients are presented with a personalized dashboard where they can view and manage their orders. The UI allows clients to browse through a catalog of available goods and add them to their cart. They can specify quantities, select variations, and apply any relevant discounts or promotions. The UI also provides search and filtering functionalities to help clients find specific products quickly.

Once the client has finalized their order, they can proceed to the checkout process, where they can review their order details, input shipping information, and select preferred payment options. The UI ensures a smooth and secure checkout experience, handling transactions through established payment gateways.

After placing an order, clients can track its progress through the UI. They can view the status of their order, including information on packaging, shipping, and estimated delivery dates. Notifications and updates are provided to keep clients informed about any changes or delays that may occur.

The UI also offers features to manage inventory and stock levels. Clients can view available stock quantities for each product, receive notifications for low stock items, and place restocking requests if necessary. This helps clients maintain adequate inventory levels and avoid any disruptions in their supply chain.
